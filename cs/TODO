    1   Exporting levels and textures from other games.
        *   GoldenEye 007 & Perfect Dark (N64)
        *   Lego Racers (PC)
        *   Marathon trilogy (PC)
        *   Spyro trilogy (PSX)
        *   Star Wars Jedi Knight & Mysteries of the Sith
        *   Misc N64 games                                      âœ“
    2   Converting textures for use in other games.
    3   Creating a texture WAD for Doom.
    4   Creating a texture WAD for Quake.
    5   Importing textures to GTK Radiant.
        *   Just a thought: With my knowledge can't I just export all the textures from the various Quake 1 WADs and use them in Radiant now?
        *   Just that I never figured out how to use Radiant for Quake 1 mapping is all.

# User settings file which saves last user settings.

# Incorporate FileReader functions into InputManager.
# Incorporate FileWriter functions into OutputCompiler. Rename OutputCompiler to OutputManager.

DONE (I think):
# ConsoleManager: Only display .map related options when .map is the selected output file type?
# ConsoleManager: Setting for outputting single or multiple files (boolean outputMultiple already exists in GeneralSettings class).
# Exclude textures setting (Model excludes textures when decompiling fileData)
# # Added function for trimming unused vertices from final model(s).

DONE (definitely)
# ConsoleManager: Multiple files to one obj.
# ConsoleManager: Accept input without fileExtension but with '/' or '\' on the end to search a folder and convert all objects contained therein.
# Optimise .map setting.
# # Presents options for WorldCraft and GTKRadiant.
# Make ProgressReporter a non-static, generalized class that can be used in multiple locations.
# # Functions have generic names such as AddStage();
